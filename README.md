# Heuristic induction of criteria tables

JavaScript implementation of heuristic induction of criteria tables algorithm as described in [Elements of Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-Machine-Learning-Morgan-Kaufmann/dp/1558603018). Implementation provides a choice of two possible heuristic functions, adjustable beam size ( 0 - maximum beam size ) and an option to show the whole process of getting the result.
